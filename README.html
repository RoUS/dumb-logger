<p><em>As though there weren't enough Ruby gems for logging.. here's another one!</em></p>

<p><code>DumbLogger</code> is a very simple package for logging messages, typically
for command-line applications.  You simply instantiate the class, set
the maximum log-level required for messages to be displayed, and
subsequently invoke the <code>#message</code> method with the text and
appropriate level associated with it.  If the logger's maximum level
is greater than or equal to the message's, the text will be written to
the logging sink.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can instead treat logging levels as bitmasks
(<em>e.g.</em>, "bit 3 means log network activity"), and messages will be
sent to the logging sink if any of the set bits in their mask are also
set in the logger's mask.</p>

<p>Messages with a loglevel (or mask) of <code>0</code> <strong>always</strong> get written to
the sink.</p>

<p>By default, <code>DumbLogger</code> uses a sink of <code>$stderr</code>, but you can tell it
to write messages somewhere else.  If the sink is a file that needs to
be opened, by default new text will be appended to any existing
content, but you can cause it to rewind and truncate the file before
writing.  If you change sinks and the current one was opened as a
file, it will be closed before switching to the new sink.</p>

<p>Sinks can be filenames, symbols, or streams (instances of <code>IO</code>);
append-mode doesn't apply to streams.</p>

<p>Two special sink symbols are recognised: <strong>:$stderr</strong> and
<strong>:$stdout</strong>.  Assigning the logger sink to either of these will
result in the sink stream being re-evaluated on each and every message
transmission.  This can be useful if <code>$stderr</code> or <code>$stdout</code> might get
redirected during application operation.</p>

<p>Text is logged using the <code>#message</code> method, which takes an arbitrary
number of strings, symbols, integers, and hashes as arguments.</p>

<ul>
<li>The last integer in the argument list will be used as the message's
level;</li>
<li>Any hashes in the argument list will be merged and used as options;
and</li>
<li>If the argument contains multiple strings, each one will be written
on a separate line.</li>
</ul>


<p>Global options that can be set with <code>#new</code> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether files should be opened in append mode;</li>
<li>whether the logger (in append mode) should always position at
EOF before writing to the sink;</li>
<li>whether loglevels are integers or bitmasks;</li>
<li>what the maximum logging level, or active logging bitmask, is;</li>
<li>where messages should be sent (the sink); and</li>
<li>a string that should be prefixed to each line written to the sink.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can define labels (names) for logging level values, so you can use
them in subsequent calls.  In addition, defining a named level creates
that method on the instance tied to that level.  That is, these are
equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>daml = DumbLogger.new(:labels =&gt; { :info =&gt; 0, :debug =&gt; 4 })
daml.info('Level 0 message')
daml.debug('Level 4 message')

daml = DumbLogger.new
daml.message(0, 'Level 0 message')
daml.message(4, 'Level 4 message')
</code></pre>

<p>Options that can be set on a per-<code>#message</code> basis include:</p>

<ul>
<li>loglevel or bitmask for the specific message (overrides any integer
values passed in the argument list);</li>
<li>a prefix string specific to the message (temporarily overriding the
default set at instantiation time);</li>
<li>whether the sink should be repositioned to EOF before writing (only
in append mode);</li>
<li>whether the (last) line of the message should be terminated with a
newline or not.  (Useful for multi-stage "<code>Doing foo: done</code>" type
messages.) <strong>Note:</strong> This is done by either including <code>DumbLogger::NO_NL</code>
in the argument list, or <code>{ :newline =&gt; false }</code> as part of an option
hash.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Add this line to your application's Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">gem('dumb-logger')
</code></pre>

<p>And then execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install dumb-logger
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre><code class="ruby">require('dumb-logger')

#
# Create a logger with integer levels, a max level of 5, and
# everything else defaulted:
#
duml = DumbLogger.new(:loglevel =&gt; 5)

#
# Will not be written to the sink ($stderr):
#
duml.message(6, 'Silent message!')

#
# Will be written to the sink no matter what:
#
# =&gt; "Logger started!  Neener, neener!\n"
#
duml.message(0, 'Logger started!  Neener, neener!')

#
# Two lines will be logged with the prefix '[DEMO] ':
#
# =&gt; "[DEMO] This is line 1\n[DEMO] This is line 2\n"
#
# Note that the default loglevel is 0, which means 'always send'.
#
duml.message('This is line 1', { :prefix =&gt; '[DEMO] ' }, 'This is line 2')

#
# Two lines will be sent to the sink, but the second one will *not*
# end with a newline:
#
# =&gt; "This will destroy your life.\nAre you sure? "
#
duml.message(DumbLogger::NO_NL,
             'This will destroy your life',
             'Are you sure? ')
