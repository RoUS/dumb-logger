require('dumb-logger/version')

#
# This is just a one-off class to allow reporting things to stderr
# according to the verbosity level.  Very simple, not a complete
# logger at all.
#
# @todo
#  Allow assignment of prefices to levels the way we now do labels.
#  Will probably only work with level-based reporting, since
#  mask-based reports may get transmitted due to a mask `AND` that
#  doesn't match any named masks.
#
# @todo
#  Add a `:seek_to_eof` option so that text written to a sink is
#  *always* possitioned after any data written by other processes.
#  (Except on the first write to a file in truncation `:append => false`
#  mode, of course.)
