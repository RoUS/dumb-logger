# This is just a one-off class to allow reporting things to stderr
# according to the verbosity level.  Very simple, not a complete
# logger at all.
#
# @todo
#  Allow assignment of prefices to levels the way we now do labels.
#  Will probably only work with level-based reporting, since
#  mask-based reports may get transmitted due to a mask `AND` that
#  doesn't match any named masks.

  #  This setting is only important when a sink is being activated,

  #
  # @note
  #  Setting this attribute *only* affects **files** subsequently
  #  opened by `DumbLogger`.  Stream sinks are *always* in
  #  append-mode.  As long as the sink is a stream, this setting will
  #  be ignored -- but it will become meaningful whenever the sink
  #  becomes a file.

  #    temporarily override instance-wide options -- *e.g.*,
  #    `{ :prefix  => 'alt' }` .  Valid *per*-call options are:
  #    * `:prefix  => String`
  #    * `:seek_to_eof => Boolean`
  #      (temporarily overrides {#seek_to_eof} logger setting.)
  #    * `:level   => Integer`
  #      (takes precedence over `:mask` if {#level_style} is {USE_LEVELS}.)
  #    * `:mask    => Integer`
  #      (takes precedence over `:level` if {#level_style} is {USE_BITMASK}.)
  #    * `:newline => Boolean`
  #      (takes precedence over {DumbLogger::NO_NL} in the argument list)
  #    * `:return  => Boolean`
  #      (alias for `:newline`; **deprecated after 1.0.0**)
  #  * If the {DumbLogger::NO_NL} value (a `Symbol`) appears in the
  #    array, or a hash element of `:newline => false` (or `:return =>
  #    false`), the report will not include a terminating newline
  #    (useful for `"progress:..done"` reports).
  #  * Any strings in the array are treated as text to be reported,
  #    one *per* line.  Each line will begin with the value of
  #    logger's value of {#prefix} (or any overriding value set with
  #    `:prefix` in a hash of options), and only the final line is
  #    subject to the {DumbLogger::NO_NL} special-casing.
  #
  # @note
  #  Use of the `:return` hash option is deprecated in versions after
  #  1.0.0.  Use `:newline` instead.
  #
  # @return [nil,Integer]
  #  Returns either `nil` if the message's loglevel is higher than the
  #  reporting level, or the level of the report.
  #
  #  If integer levels are being used, a non-`nil` return value is
  #  that of the message.  If bitmask levels are being used, the
  #  return value is a mask of the active level bits that applied to
  #  the message -- *i.e.*, `message_mask & logging_mask` .
