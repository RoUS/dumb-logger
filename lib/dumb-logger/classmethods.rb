#
# A simple ( *very* simple) class to provide wrapping for writing
# status text to files or streams.  Very basic, not intended to be a
# complete logger at all.  However, it tries to be capable and
# featureful within its boundaries.
#
# The basic concept comes from command-line utilities which adjust the
# volume of their status reporting based on either degrees of
# verbosity ( *e.g.*, `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, *et cetera*) or categories
# by bitmask ( *e.g.*, `-d1`, `-d8`, or `-d9`, in which case the last
# is a combination of the first two), like the `xdvi` command's
# `-debug` option.

    # Instance method builder (like :attr_accessor) for Boolean flags.
    # Defines a reader (`name`), writer (`name=`), and query (`name?`)
    # method for each flag name in the list.

    # @param [Symbol] hashivar
    #  Symbolic name for the instance variable that the flag names
    #  index.

    #  Returns an array of the symbolic names of the accessor methods
    #  created.
